# PatHapouf

This is a R script that finds out the most probable number of haplomes per subpopulations present in a sequenced genetic pool. It was initially developped to analyze the content of ant queens spermathecae, that may contain a number of paternal haplomes of various origins. 

## Principle

The general idea of the analysis is to evaluate the likelihood of all possible combinations of haplome numbers up to a maximum number per subpopulation, $m_{max}$. For instance, if $m_{max}=2$ and $G=2$ supopulations are present, five likelihoods will be computed: $p(m_{1} = 1, m_{1} = 1 \vert DATA}$
